    <p>Ans-1 : A "Hello, World!" program is generally a computer program that ignores any input and outputs or displays a message similar to "Hello, World!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.</p>

    <p>Ans-2:Comments in HTML are used to provide information or explanations about the code to other developers who might read it in the future. Comments do not affect how the HTML code is rendered in a web browser, as they are ignored by the browser.

<p>Ans-3:tags:HTML uses tags to define the structure and content of a web page.
elements:An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document, consisting of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
attributs:HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. An attribute consists of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=) and enclosed in double quotes ("). Here are some commonly used HTML attributes:

class - Defines a class name for an HTML element. Used for styling purposes with CSS.
Example: <p class="text-bold">

id - Defines a unique identifier for an HTML element. Used for JavaScript purposes or for linking to a specific section of a web page.
Example: <section id="about">

style - Defines inline styles for an HTML element. Used for applying styles directly to an element.
Example: <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">

src - Defines the source URL of an image or media file.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

href - Defines the URL of a link.
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Example Link</a></p>

<p>Ans-4: HTML entities are special characters that cannot be included in HTML documents using normal keyboard characters. For example, if we  want to display a copyright symbol (Â©) in your HTML document, you cannot simply type it on your keyboard, as it will not be recognized by the browser. Instead, you need to use an HTML entity to represent the symbol.

HTML entities are written using a special syntax that consists of an ampersand (&), followed by a code or name that represents the entity, and then a semicolon (;). For example, the HTML entity for the copyright symbol is &copy;.

HTML entities can be used to represent a wide range of special characters, such as mathematical symbols, currency symbols, and foreign language characters. Some commonly used HTML entities include:

&nbsp;: Non-breaking space
&mdash;: Em dash
&ldquo;: Left double quotation mark
&rdquo;: Right double quotation mark
&copy;: Copyright symbol
&reg;: Registered trademark symbol</p>
To write comments in HTML, we can use the following syntax:
<!-- This is a comment -->
Anything we can write between <!-- and --> will be treated as a comment and will not be displayed on the web page.</p>
